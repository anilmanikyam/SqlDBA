always on uses snapshot isolation level 2005 to read the data on secondary 
Article-tables,sp,viwes etc..
Publication- group of articles
Distributor-All the articles chnages chnages details are stored in distibitorand transfered to subscriber




Snapshot replication-Snapshot agent (locks)

Transactional replication (only at the time of snapshot process it acquires th locks)

uni directional --if any chnages to the target database then replication will break
if the objects are not part of replication then wont break.

All the tables which are participated in transactional replication which should contain atleast one primary key column

Snapshot agent--used at first stage(to intializing)

Snapshot agent take the snapshot of publisher and before apply it on subscriber it will drop table and re create and then apply generated script bcp utility to copy the data

Log reader agent --get the changes the publisher and update in distibutor database

Distributed agent --get the info from distributor database to subscriber database

Merge Replication--multi directional 

if same row chnages at both the publisher and subscriber then it will handled by using uniqueidentifier column
and property ROWGUIDCOL

Merge agent 

Peer to Peer


Distributor: contains info about publication database,articles,progress state of replication, T sql commands executed on publisher

latency:time it will take to replicate 

snapshot taken by bcp utility and stored in snapshot folder.

Snapshot replication:(shared locks)

Normal snapshot replication when snapshot genration process starts on publisher database it locks the entire all and entire tables which are participated in the 
replication so data consistency will be there at that time there are no updates or deletes are wont perform on those tables y beacause all the tables are locked


Trasactional replication:(lived locks)

when snapshot generation process starts it acquires the lock on table and releases the each lock row one by one.and when snapshot started it will note one marker in log file til 
snashot complete when the snashot applied on subscriber then drop and recreation of all tables will occure and that marker logs will apply now.

*****************
SELECT log_reuse_wait_desc,

***********************

replication causes the log file growth (VLFs cannot be reused)

Pull subscription:  We have a different subscriptions and we need to stop and start the synchronization on subscriber on different timings then we can use pull
Push Subscription: any where (general)--fastest data moving from distributor to subscriber 

Distibutor agent:(Different number of publications)
If we have a different number of publications and we have a table with foriegn references in two tables and two tables are in different publication 
then the distibutor agent inserts the data into publication in different order then we will get logical incosinstency 

so better to maintain those in same publication(Any way Foriegn key columns wont replicate in the replication)

******************************************

All the articles with in a publication are reside on database object.

******************************************


Markers written into database logs during the snapshot generation.and then log reader agent picks those markers and then distibutor agent uses these markers which chnages need to be applied on subscriber.
 

Distibutor Properties--we can add the one more distributor
Publication Properties--We can add database in the replication (if it is enable then only db_owner will do the replication on the publication properties.)

Publisher:
PAL(Publication Access List ):Prevents from unauthorized users access the replication data

Subscriber:

Synchronize schedules:
Run continuously-run continuously
Run on dmand--manual
Run on schedule -schedule

Initialize when
Imediately
At first sync

Retention settings will configure in publication(1) and distributor(3) only 
MAx and Min retention settings--the max time the data in distributor before going to subcriber
min retention -min time the data in distributor after the data went to subscriber 

snap shot immediately and keep the snapshot available to initialize subscription --every snapshot is valid for atleast max retention time.

Publication retention
in push publication if the retention lapses the subscriber then entire subscription got removed and in push orphan remian in the distributor and we need to remove manually.

Replication jobs:

Snapshot agent:

<ServerName>-<Publication database>-<Publication>-<Number>

Log reader agent:

<Publisher>-<Publication database>-<Number> (If any other publication can also use the same job )

Distributor Agent:

Push:
<Publisher>-<Publication database>-<Publication>-<Subscriber>-<Number>
Pull:
<Publisher>-<Publication database>-<Publication>-<Subscriber>-<subscription database>-<GUID>

SQL Agent Jobs:

Agent history clean up-Delete the agent history records that keep track of agent's performance  

Distibutor Clean up job-Deletes the old transaction history form the distribution database

Replication agents check up-monitors the replication agents and creates an entry in the windows event log if it fails

Replication monitor refresher for distribution-used by replication monitor to refresh cached queries.

Reinitilaize subscriptions having data validation failures-Identifies subscriptions with data validation error and sets them up for re initilization.

Log reader agent job

Snapshot agent job

Expired subscription clean up-Removes subscriptions that fail to connect to the subscriber with in the publication retention period.


Merge replication:

Snapshot agent 

Triggers tables and views

Merge agent

Snashot process -It acquires lock n all published databases 

Actually it wont acquire the locks on published tables it locked the meta data of published tables which were generated by the merge replication triggers.
The merge triggers will write data in the meta data tables to at that time it get locked (how much it got locked depends on the size of data from last sync)

Merge replication defines 3 triggers on published database

MSMerge_???_Hexadecimal number(Internal article number)

???--del,ins,upd

MSmerge_tr_alterschemaonly 

MSmerge_tr_altertable

MSmerge_tr_altertrigger

MSmerge_tr_alterview

The chnages stored in metadata tables and tables begin with MSmerge_.and some views also 

The merge agents gets those chnages wich are stored on those meta data (which are triggered by the replication triggers)

**************************************************
Commands

Publisher-sp_replcmds

Distibutor:MSreplcmds and MSreplTrasc

Subscriber:

sp_replmonitorsubscriberpending

***************************************************

Tracer Tockens: tracer tockens are special timestamp trasaction that are stored with the log files and log reader agent get those data and store it into distributor tables
2 tables are there in the distributor and we can find the info about subscriber and publisher on those.

**************************

SQL 2012 --replication supports alwayson,replication supports extended events
Limitations:it wont support bidirectional and peer to peer replication when we are using always on
Subscriber wont be a publisher at any point of time.

SQL 2016-in memory OLTP

SQL 2014 


Merge replication :

Most of the articles are schema-only articles that means only object defenition should be replicated Procedure execution is not possible

Highlighted table is download -only 

If we can go to articles properties-->if we can select synchronization direction 

Bidirectional download-only subscriber,allow subscriber chnages

Download-only to subscriber,prohibit subscriber changes
